                        <p>
                        <br>
                        A data warehouse can be described as a system that stores data from the operations of a company and other external sources. They store historical information to allow for analysis of
                        <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> data over a period of time.
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Due to the many disparate systems that may exist in an organization, data exists in different formats in these systems, but a data warehouse is there to apply a uniform formatting to the collected data from all these systems. Due to their ability to allow analysis of prehistoric data, data warehouses are effective in presenting facts about the organization thus making it easier for business leaders to make better business decisions about the organization’s future and current market position.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Due to the increase in data from across all departments in all organizations, it is almost a definite benefit for every business to adopt data warehouses. SMEs also suffer from disparate information across their systems and would benefit too from having all their data integrated into one format. The main purpose of a data warehouse is to enhance decision making and that applies to businesses of different sizes too. Although the implementation will be different from a small business to a large business, there are different approaches which may be applied to develop a data warehouse which is most appropriate for each size.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Ralph Kimball proposed the bottom-up approach which supports the development of data marts first which collective integrate to produce a larger data warehouse. The benefit of such a approach is that it is less complex to develop, thus a small business start-up will not have to hire a large team for the development of their data warehouse. Due to start-up’s limited resources, comparative to larger businesses, it is essential that development time of projects is minimized. Data warehouses developed using the Kimball approach take less time and less initial costs.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The availability of these two approaches can simplify the decision of implementing a data warehouse, whether in a large and old-existing organization or a start-up business. Small startups may also look into cheap and lightweight architectures for their business intelligence tools. As a result, no business (regardless of size) is exempt from the possibility of taking full advantage of data warehousing’s organizational benefits.
